        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 (3 pound) chicken, cut into pieces</li>
            <li>1 large onion, quartered and sliced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
            <li>⅔ cup low sodium soy sauce</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken pieces until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a plate and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add onion and garlic to the skillet; cook until softened and brown, about 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour in soy sauce and vinegar and season with garlic powder, black pepper, and bay leaf.</li>
            <li>Return chicken to pan, increase heat to high, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until chicken is tender and cooked through, 35 to 40 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
